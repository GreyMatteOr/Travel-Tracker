# Travel Tracker

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate fluency of the following Front-end design principles:
  - Integrated JS/CSS/HTML functionality
  - Efficient, Object-Oriented Information Hierarchy
  - Utilizing Asynchronous Execution to access information API's
  - Importing Modules, and using and using unfamiliar codebases
  
The site itself is a Mock-up of a Travel-agency's Website. It hosts trip and user Data on a central Server, and allows users to book trips and see if it's been accepted yet or now.

In the future, it will also let an Agent parse and modify Requested Trips.
